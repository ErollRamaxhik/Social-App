# Social-App
Social App

This project includes (Html,Css(Bootstrap) and Vanilla Javascript) and some parts are written in Albanian language.

This Small Social App project includes (Users, Posts and Comments) and it's fetched from JSON Placeholder API. The data is sorted dinamically and all variables are linked with each other (Users->Posts->Comments)
This Project has 1 main home page, 1 post page and 2 pages(profile and post) which are embedded inside 1 (Main Profile Page) page.
In Home page, image,name and email is linked directly to the profile page, also post title is directly linked into a post page.
Inside Home page you can see more comments by clicking show more (Shiko me shume kommente) and also you can make post request to the JSON Placeholder server (For the results you can open inspect and see console)
Note that post request is hard coded but you can easily make it dinamic in script file (index.js).
All pages are responsive except Profile page (I didn't had time unfortunatelly but it's easy fix :) )
